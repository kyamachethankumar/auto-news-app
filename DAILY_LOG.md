### Day 0
✅ Created GitHub repository
✅ Created ROADMAP.md
Feeling: Calm and ready

### Day 1
Understood what a news aggregator is.
Clear about what the app will and will not do.

Your app WILL:
✅ Automatically fetch news (RSS / free APIs)
✅ Show:
Headline
Short description / summary
Source name
Time published
✅ Open the original website on click
✅ Update itself automatically
✔️ No daily effort from you.

Your app will NOT:
❌ Copy full news articles
❌ Rewrite or replace original publishers
❌ Hide the source
❌ Scrap paid articles
❌ Pretend the news is yours

This keeps your app:
✅ Legal
✅ Play Store safe
✅ Stress‑free
